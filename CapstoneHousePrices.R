###Download data
dl <- read_csv("data/train.csv")



###Clean data

#NA's , 0's and X1st etc

#Huge amount of factoring and manipulating - is this necessary????? Look at comments section


###Split Data
# Ensure naming is consistent everywhere - train vs. training vs. final vs. validation etc - also boruta uses a different set because training gets split/overwritten
#90 / 10

#And then 80 /20


###Explore Data

#Exploring dataset could be diffcult when the quantity of variables is quite huge. Therefore, I mainly focused on the exploration of numeric
#variables in this report. The descriptive analysis of dummy variables are mostly finished by drawing box plots. Some dummy variables, like 'Street',
#are appeared to be ineffective due to the extreme box plot. The numeric variables are sorted out before turning dummy variables into numeric form.



##Whole Boruta thing
#Check which data source is used


##3 correlation plots from Fun With + 1 from XGBoost

##Simple scatterplot matrix (pairs) + 1 from XGBoost (pairs)

##3 scatterplot charts - not sure if they really show anything!!

## Sales Price vs. Year Built => newer houses worth more
